This model is typically a transformer-based architecture like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT that has been fine-tuned on a dataset for text classification.<br><br>\n",

        "**Model Inference:**\n",
        "\n",

This classification head consists of one or more dense layers that take the final contextual representation of the input text as input and produce predictions for the classification task.<br><br>\n",
        "- For example, in binary classification tasks, the classification head may consist of a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function that outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of the input text belonging to a particular class.<br><br>\n",

Mechas, Krieg, Romantik, Komödie, Rivalität, unerwartete Twsits, Explotionen, Mindgames und mehr mechas! was sonst wollen Sie! xD es völlig verdient seinen Platz als einer der besten Animes jemals gemacht. der einzige Aspekt, den ich als Fehler sehe, ist die Kunst mit einem 9/10 die Menschen scheinen ein wenig verformt oder zu dünn, aber wenn Sie es nutzen ist toll!.Der Benutzer will Freiheit. und es hat bei weitem die beste Geschichte, die ich je gesehen habe, Sie nur an sie von der zweiten Folge und Cant Stop bis zum Ende. fast perfekt serie, recomended zu jedem, der ein Mensch ist Bienen (Nevermind, mein Hund mochte es)\n"

        "      Segmentation:\n",
        "      BLEU first divides the candidate translation (machine-generated text) and reference translations (human-generated text) into segments, usually sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "      N-gram matching:\n",
        "      It then compares each segment of the candidate translation to the corresponding segments in the reference translations. BLEU considers the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words) between the candidate and reference translations.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Precision calculation:\n",
        "      For each n-gram size, BLEU calculates precision, which measures the proportion of n-grams in the candidate translation that appear in the reference translations.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Brevity penalty:\n",
        "      BLEU also penalizes translations that are shorter than the reference translations to prevent shorter translations from receiving artificially high scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "      BLEU score:\n",
        "      Finally, BLEU combines the precision scores for different n-gram sizes using a geometric mean and applies the brevity penalty to compute the overall BLEU score\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scoring range:**<br><br>\n",
        "- BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates a better match between the machine-generated and human-translated texts. A score of 1 means the machine translation is identical to a human translation.<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage:**<br><br>\n",
        "- BLEU is commonly used for evaluating machine translation systems. It helps researchers and developers assess the quality of their translation models and make improvements.<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
